I am a Ph.D Students in Italian National Doctoral Program in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Pisa and University of Bari "Aldo Moro".
In 2020, I completed a Master Degree in Communication Design at the Polytechnic University of Milan, developing my thesis at the DensityDesign research lab. After that, I obtained a one-year Master Degree in Big Data Analytics and Social Mining at the University of Pisa.
I am a Memeber of the [XAI research Group](https://xai-project.eu/) and [IVU lab](http://ivu.di.uniba.it/)


## Research Interest

My research Interests focus on Human Centered AI, Explainable AI and Visual Analytics. 
I am currently working on developing Explainable User Interfaces.
